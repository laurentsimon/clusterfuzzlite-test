# clusterfuzzlite-test

1. Start with a codebase that has fuzzers like this [example](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/example/my-api-repo)
2. Make a github repo out of that repo.
3. Follow the ClusterFuzzLite [docs](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzzlite/overview/) on setting up ClusterFuzzLite on Github.
Hint: You can use the [build.sh and Dockerfile](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/example) for example as inspiration for the build integration.
